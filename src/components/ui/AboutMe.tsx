        I&#39;m Mohan Rai, a filmmaker, film educator, and film culture promoter
        in Nepal. I&#39;ve directed documentaries, including &quot;Anjali,&quot;
        exploring the life of a transgender protagonist, screened at global film
        festivals. My feature film &quot;Mahanagar&quot; received Best Film,
        Director, and Screenwriter awards at the Nepal International Film
        Festival 2022, among other honors. As the Festival Manager for the
        Nepal-European Union Film Festival, I&#39;ve been involved for three
        years. I lead Middleway Films, offering filmmaking courses and
        contributing to Nepal&#39;s cinematic landscape. I&#39;ve also edited
        &quot;Juxtaposition,&quot; a book on Nepali cinema, and translated/edit
        Nepali editions of books, such as &quot;Directing Feature Films&quot; by
        Mark Travis.
